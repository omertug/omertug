I am a Business Analyst. 
I can describe myself as a person who is personal and professional, extremely curious, and focused on lifelong learning in all aspects of life.

I love investigating and solving complex SQL queries. Here, I will try to give examples of these queries.

I have been continuing my professional career as a Business Analyst in the field of Software Development for about 12 years.
